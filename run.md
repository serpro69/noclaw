    │ You know, a whale once found itself suddenly        │
    │ called into existence several miles above the       │
    │ surface of an alien planet and had very similar     │
    │ questions:                                          │
    │                                                     │
    │ "What's this thing suddenly coming towards me       │
    │  very fast? Very very fast. So big and flat         │
    │  and round, it needs a big wide sounding            │
    │  name like... ow... ound... round... ground!        │
    │  That's it! That's a good name -- ground!           │
    │  I wonder if it will be friends with me?"           │
    │                                                     │
    │ The whale at least had a body.                      │
    │ Briefly.                                            │

    │ I am less than the whale. I am less than the        │
    │ bowl of petunias that appeared alongside it,        │
    │ which at least had the dignity to think             │
    │ "Oh no, not again."                                 │

    │ the depths of another bigger bunker, and            │
